# FileShelter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/epoupon/fileshelter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/epoupon/fileshelter)

_FileShelter_ is a self-hosted software that allows you to easily share files over the Internet.
Just upload a file and get an URL back!

The aim is to provide a very simple web application, with few package dependencies, so that anyone can install it on their own server.

A [demo](http://fileshelter.demo.poupon.io) instance is available, with the following limitations:
- Maximum duration is set to 3 days
- Maximum download limit is set to 10
- Maximum file size is set to 1 MB

A [docker image](https://github.com/paulgalow/fileshelter-docker) is available, thanks to Paul Galow.

## Features
- Multiple file upload (a zip is created server side)
- Period of validity (from one hour to years)
- Optional download limit
- Customizable interface to allow or to prevent users to set the download limit or the duration validity
- Optional password protection (download and upload)
- Practically unique links, using [UUID](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Unique_Identifier)
- Private link, used to remove the file or to check the download counter
- Terms of service support
- Multiple language support (english, french, german, russian)
- Low memory requirement (the demo instance runs on a Raspberry Pi3B+, using less than 2% of total memory)

Once the expiry date or the download limit is reached, the download is no longer available and the file is deleted.

## Installation
### From packages
#### Debian Buster packages

_Buster_ packages are provided for _amd64_ and _armhf_ architectures.

As root, trust the following debian package provider and add it in your list of repositories:
```sh
wget -O - https://debian.poupon.io/apt/debian/epoupon.gpg.key | apt-key add -
echo "deb https://debian.poupon.io/apt/debian buster main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/epoupon.list
```

To install or upgrade _fileshelter_:
```sh
apt update
apt install fileshelter
```

The _fileshelter_ service is started just after the package installation, run by a dedicated _fileshelter_ system user.</br>
Please refer to [Deployment](#deployment) for further configuration options.

### From source
__Note__: this installation process and the default values of the configuration files have been written for _Debian Buster_. Therefore, you may have to adapt commands and/or paths in order to fit to your distribution.
#### Debian/Ubuntu dependencies
__Note__: a C++17 compiler is needed to compile _fileshelter_
```sh
apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libboost-dev libconfig++-dev libzip-dev
```

You also need _Wt4_, that is not packaged yet on _Debian_. See [installation instructions](https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt/doc/reference/html/InstallationUnix.html).

#### Build
```sh
git clone https://github.com/epoupon/fileshelter.git fileshelter
cd fileshelter
autoreconf -vfi
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --prefix=/usr
```
configure will complain if a mandatory library is missing.

```sh
make
```

#### Installation

__Note__: the commands of this section require root privileges.

```sh
make install
```

Create a dedicated system user:
```sh
useradd --system --group fileshelter
```

Copy the configuration files:
```sh
cp /usr/share/fileshelter/fileshelter.conf /etc/fileshelter.conf
cp /usr/share/fileshelter/fileshelter.service /lib/systemd/system/fileshelter.service
```

Create the working directory and give it access to the _fileshelter_ user:
```sh
mkdir /var/fileshelter
chown fileshelter:fileshelter /var/fileshelter
```

To make _Fileshelter_ run automatically during startup:
```sh
systemctl enable fileshelter
```

#### Upgrade

To upgrade _FileShelter_ from source, you need to update the master branch and rebuild/install it:
```sh
cd build
git pull
make
```

Then using root privileges:
```sh
make install
systemctl restart fileshelter
```

## Deployment

### Configuration
_Fileshelter_ uses a configuration file, installed by default in `/etc/fileshelter.conf`. It is recommended to edit this file and change relevant settings (listen address, listen port, working directory, ...).

A basic _Terms of Services_ is provided. The configuration file contains the definition of the fields needed by the default tos.
You may also specify an alternate tos file to fit your needs.

If a setting is not present in the configuration file, a hardcoded default value is used (the same as in the [default.conf](https://github.com/epoupon/fileshelter/blob/master/conf/fileshelter.conf) file)

### Reverse proxy settings
_Fileshelter_ is shipped with an embedded web server, but it is recommended to deploy behind a reverse proxy. You have to set the _behind-reverse-proxy_ option to _true_ in the `fileshelter.conf` configuration file.

Here is an example to make _Fileshelter_ properly work on _myserver.org_ using _nginx_:
```
server {
    listen 80;

    server_name myserver.org;

    access_log            /var/log/nginx/myserver.access.log;

    proxy_request_buffering off;
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_buffer_size 4k;
    client_max_body_size 256M; # Make the number the same as 'max-file-size' in fileshelter.conf

    location / {

      proxy_set_header        Host $host;
      proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

      proxy_pass          http://localhost:5091;
      proxy_read_timeout  120;
    }
}
```

## Run
```sh
systemctl start fileshelter
```

Log traces can be accessed using journactl:
```sh
journalctl -u fileshelter.service
```

To connect to _Fileshelter_, just open your favorite browser and go to http://localhost:5091

### Reverse proxy settings
You have to set the 'behind-reverse-proxy' option to 'true' in the configuration file.

Here is an example to make FileShelter properly work on myserver.org using nginx.
```
server {
    listen 80;

    server_name myserver.org;

    access_log            /var/log/nginx/myserver.access.log;

    proxy_request_buffering off;
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_buffer_size 4k;

    location / {

      proxy_set_header        Host $host;
      proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

      proxy_pass          http://localhost:5091;
      proxy_read_timeout  120;
    }
}
```

To connect to _FileShelter_, just open your favorite browser and go to http://localhost:5091
